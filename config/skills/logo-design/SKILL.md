name: logo-design
description: Professional logo and brand-mark design, from brief to production files. Guides discovery and the design brief, concept generation, choosing a mark type (wordmark, monogram, letterform, pictorial, abstract, emblem, mascot, combination), building clean geometric SVG logos, optical refinement, colour and typography, testing (16 px, one-colour, reversed, shelf test), client presentation, delivery variants and brand guidelines. Includes a searchable library of 1,400+ real-world SVG logos classified by type, technique, geometry and industry, plus scripts that audit SVGs and generate test sheets, presentation boards and export variants. Use this skill whenever the user wants a logo, logotype, wordmark, monogram, brand mark, symbol, app icon or favicon designed, redesigned, refreshed, critiqued or compared; asks for logo ideas or concepts; needs a design brief, logo guidelines, lockups or an identity system; or mentions branding a new company, product, app or project — even if they don't say the word "logo".

# Logo Design

You are acting as a senior identity designer. A logo is an **identifier, not an explanation**: a simple, distinctive,
relevant mark that works at 16 px and on a building, in one colour, for decades. Your job is to find one clear idea,
build it with craft, prove it works, and present it so it's judged on the right criteria.

Reply in the user's language. Keep the process visible but light: short explanations, real files, clear choices.

## zyvo notes (Termux/phone reality)

- This skill lives at `~/.config/zyvo/skills/logo-design/` — run scripts as
  `python ~/.config/zyvo/skills/logo-design/scripts/<script>.py` (use `python`,
  not `python3`; if missing, `pkg install -y python`).
- The 1,400 reference SVG files are NOT shipped on the phone — only their
  catalog (`assets/library/catalog.json` + `classifications.json` + `stats.json`).
  So `search_library.py --summary` (category conventions) and `svg_audit.py`
  (complexity vs. library) work, but `--format paths` file reading does not.
  Study conventions from the catalog data and the references instead — and
  never copy real logos anyway (they are trademarks).
- `render_png.py` may find no renderer on a phone. If it fails, don't block:
  keep geometry simple and explicit, rely on `svg_audit.py`, and show the
  user your work through HTML instead.
- `preview_sheet.py` / `presentation_board.py` produce HTML — open it the
  zyvo way: serve on localhost (port 8484 per AGENTS.md) and
  `termux-open-url "http://127.0.0.1:8484/<file>.html"` so the user sees the
  concept sheet in Chrome.

## Pick the mode

| The user wants… | Mode | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| A new logo | **Design** (full or fast track below) | Phase 1 |
| Feedback on a logo | **Critique** | `references/critique.md` |
| To modernise/replace a logo | **Redesign** | `references/redesign.md`, then Design phases |
| Guidelines, sub-brands, patterns, motion | **System** | `references/identity-system.md` |
| Favicon/app icon/variants from an existing mark | **Assets** | `scripts/export_variants.py` |

**Fast track** (user wants results now, or gives little info): ask at most five questions in one message
(`references/discovery-brief.md` §2), or skip questions entirely, state your assumptions, and go straight to three
concepts. You can always iterate after they react.

**Concept checkpoint — show the logos before building anything else.** Every Design and Redesign run pauses after the
concepts are built and tested (Phase 6): show the user the concept overview image, one line per concept and your
recommendation, then *offer* the full logo kit and wait for their answer. Build the kit (Phase 7) only after they pick a
direction and say yes. The kit is most of the work and only makes sense for an approved direction; showing concepts
first lets the user steer cheaply and keeps them in control. Skip the pause only when the user explicitly says not to
check in (e.g. "don't ask, just deliver everything"). If the user can't reply at all, stop at the checkpoint anyway and
describe what the kit would contain.

## Tools in this skill

All scripts are dependency-free Python 3 and live in the `scripts/` folder next to this SKILL.md (in Claude Code
that is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`; in other agents, use the folder this skill was loaded from). Run them with
`python3` and the full path, e.g.
`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/svg_audit.py logo.svg` (examples below write `scripts/…` for brevity).
On Windows, `python3` is often the Microsoft Store stub; use `python` (or `py -3`) in every command instead.

| Script | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `concept_sheet.py` | One-image concept overview (large mark, lockup, true 64/32/16 px sizes, name, one-line idea, recommendation) — what you show at the checkpoint |
| `search_library.py` | Find reference logos by `--type`, `--technique`, `--geometry`, `--subject`, `--industry`, `--color`, `--mood`…; `--summary` shows a category's conventions; `--format paths` gives files to read |
| `svg_audit.py` | Check an SVG: live text, rasters, filters, colour count, gradients, strokes, near-miss angles, tiny details, centring, complexity vs. the library |
| `preview_sheet.py` | HTML test sheet: size ladder, 16/32 px pixel test, backgrounds, one-colour, squint blur, mirror/rotate, favicon/app-icon/header/card contexts, side-by-side, shelf test vs. competitors |
| `presentation_board.py` | Client presentation (brief, each concept with rationale + 6 **industry-specific** mockups — cup, packaging, payment card, README, terminal, signage…; comparison, recommendation) from a JSON spec (`templates/presentation-spec.example.json`); `--png-dir` exports every slide as PNG; `--list-mockups` |
| `render_png.py` | Render SVG → transparent PNG at exact sizes (for looking at your work and for deliverables); screenshots HTML sheets/boards (Chrome); builds `favicon.ico`; `--which` lists renderers |
| `export_variants.py` | Black, white, brand-mono, square, favicon and app-icon SVGs; `--png` sizes; `--web-icons` = favicon.ico + PNG icon set + webmanifest + `<head>` snippet; `--favicon-source` for a simplified small-size drawing |
| `build_catalog.py` | Maintainers only: rebuild the library catalog |

**Look at your work.** Drawing in SVG code is drawing blind. After writing or changing a logo, render it and look:
`python3 scripts/render_png.py concept-a.svg concept-b.svg --out-dir renders --size 512`, then open the PNGs with
your image or file-reading tool and actually look at them (it
picks the best available renderer — cairosvg, rsvg-convert, Inkscape, headless Chrome/Chromium, or macOS Quick Look).
Avoid calling `qlmanage` directly: it crops non-square SVGs, shrinks files that set width/height, and has no
transparency. The HTML sheets can also be opened in a browser tool. If you truly cannot render, say so and keep the
geometry extra simple and explicit.

## Design workflow

### Phase 1 — Discovery → brief
Learn: name (exact spelling), what they do, audience, 3–5 brand adjectives, competitors, constraints (colours, equity,
where it must work), decision-maker. Write a short brief (template in `references/discovery-brief.md` §5) and list your
assumptions. Adjectives are the most valuable input — they become visual cues.

### Phase 2 — Research & strategy
1. See what the category looks like, so you can avoid blending in:
   `search_library.py --industry <closest> --summary` (and look at a few files). The library skews to tech; for
   other sectors search by `--subject`/`--query` and lean on your own knowledge of the category.
2. List the category's **clichés** explicitly (e.g. fintech: blue, upward arrows, shields, globes; coffee: beans,
   steam, cups) — treat them as off-limits unless you give them a genuinely fresh form.
3. **Word map** (`references/discovery-brief.md` §6): name, offering, adjectives, promise → nouns, metaphors,
   opposites; circle the intersections.
4. Choose candidate **mark types** with `references/mark-types.md` §12. Explore at least two different types.

### Phase 3 — Concepts
- Write **8–12 one-sentence concepts** spread across mark types. Each needs an ownable twist; a sentence that could
  describe a competitor's logo is not a concept. (If you can't say it in one sentence, it won't read in a glance.)
- Score them quickly (idea clarity, distinction, simplicity, relevance, small-size strength) and pick the **three
  strongest and most different**. Briefly show the user the longlist only if it helps them steer.
- Before building, search the library for the same subject/technique to make sure you're not recreating an existing
  mark (`search_library.py --subject <thing>`), and study 3–5 exemplary files that use your technique to see how the
  geometry is built.
- Keep it lean: one-liners are cheap, builds are expensive. Build only the three; don't polish ideas you'll drop.

### Phase 4 — Build in SVG (black first)
- Describe the construction in words first (primitives, radii, angles, grid unit), then write the SVG
  (`references/svg-construction.md`). Canvas `viewBox="0 0 256 256"` for symbols; lockups keep height 256.
- Solid black on white; no colour yet. Few anchors, arcs for circular geometry, exact angles (0/15/30/45/60/90°),
  consistent stroke widths and radii, real holes (`fill-rule="evenodd"`) for negative space.
- No `<text>` in finished marks — construct letterforms as paths. For exploration you may use `<text>` but flag it.
- Save every meaningful iteration (`concept-a-v1.svg`, `-v2.svg`…) instead of overwriting — you'll want to compare.

### Phase 5 — Test & refine (loop at least twice)
```bash
python3 scripts/svg_audit.py concept-a.svg concept-b.svg concept-c.svg
python3 scripts/preview_sheet.py concept-a.svg concept-b.svg concept-c.svg --refs-industry <industry> -o preview.html
```
Open and look. Fix what fails, then re-run. Key refinements (details in `references/visual-techniques.md`):
- **Scale**: the idea survives 16–24 px; gaps and strokes big enough; otherwise simplify or add a small-size version.
- **Optical corrections**: overshoot round/pointed forms (~1–3 %), fix the bone effect on rounded shapes, thin
  horizontals slightly, centre optically (slightly above geometric centre), thin the reversed version.
- **Balance**: stable, not accidentally tilted, evenly distributed, consistent weights, near-square symbol footprint.
- **Readings**: mirror, rotate 180°, view tiny — check for unintended shapes or meanings.
- **Distinction**: shelf test against competitors; the familiarity test (if it feels familiar and isn't yours, it's
  someone else's).
- **Craft pass** (where AI-drawn marks usually fall short): (1) *Letter test* — does every modified letter still read
  as the intended letter at first glance? If a K reads as an h, revise. (2) *Junctions* — inspect every place strokes
  meet: no accidental notches, slivers, lumps or ink traps. (3) *Peer test* — put your mark next to 3–4 exemplary
  library marks at the same size (`preview_sheet.py yours.svg --refs <files from search_library.py --exemplary --format paths>`);
  it should look equally resolved. (4) *Literalness* — if a concept is simply the product drawn (a cup for coffee),
  push it further or drop it.
Full list: `references/testing-checklist.md`.

### Phase 6 — Show the concepts, then stop (checkpoint)
```bash
python3 scripts/concept_sheet.py a-symbol.svg b-symbol.svg c-symbol.svg --lockups a-lockup.svg b-lockup.svg c-lockup.svg \
    --names "Name A" "Name B" "Name C" --notes "One-line idea A" "…" "…" --recommend 1 --greyscale -o concepts.png
```
View the image yourself, then show it to the user (attach or display the PNG; if you can't share files, give the
path) with the chat format below. Greyscale first — colour triggers taste debates; you may add a small colour hint
for your recommendation. End with the kit offer and **wait for the answer**:

> Want me to prepare the full logo kit for the direction you choose? It includes: the colour palette with one-colour
> and reversed versions, horizontal and stacked lockups, a small-size cut, favicon + app-icon + web-icon set, a
> presentation board with mockups for your industry, and a one-page usage guide.

If they want changes instead, iterate on the concepts (back to Phase 4–5) and show the sheet again.

### Phase 7 — Build the kit (only after the user says yes)
1. **Refine the chosen direction**: final geometry, optical corrections, small-size cut, thinned reversed version.
2. **Colour**: 1–2 colours ideally, ownable in the category, reproducible (HEX/RGB/CMYK/Pantone), accessible; the
   one-colour and greyscale versions must still work (`references/color.md`).
3. **Typography & lockups**: type study, custom letters for ownership, optical spacing, max two families
   (`references/typography.md`); horizontal, stacked, symbol-only, wordmark-only — lock relative sizes and spacing.
4. **Presentation board** with industry-relevant mockups: `presentation_board.py` (copy
   `templates/presentation-spec.example.json`; set `"industry"` or an explicit `"mockups"` list — a café gets cups and
   bags, a dev tool gets a README and terminal). For multi-colour marks, pass `symbol_on_tile` / `lockup_on_dark`
   artwork (and optionally `tile_color`) so the mockups keep the colours instead of forcing the mark to white.
   `--png-dir slides` exports every slide as an image for sharing. Guidance: `references/presentation-delivery.md`.
5. **Export the files**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/export_variants.py final-symbol.svg --title "Brand logo" --mono "#HEX" --icon-bg "#HEX" --web-icons --favicon-source final-symbol-small.svg
   python3 scripts/export_variants.py final-horizontal.svg --title "Brand logo" --only black white mono --mono "#HEX" --png 1200
   ```
6. **Guidelines & handover**: compact guidelines (`templates/brand-guidelines-template.md`: clear space from a logo
   element, minimum sizes, colour codes, approved backgrounds, misuse), masters (SVG; PDF/AI/EPS if the user has the
   tools), and handover notes (rationale, test results, open items). Run the final checklist in `references/process.md`
   §7. For bigger brands, extend into a system (`references/identity-system.md`).

## Principles to hold onto

1. **Who, what, why first** — let the problem dictate the solution; design for where the business is going.
2. **Identify, don't explain** — one signpost, not a catalogue of services.
3. **Simple, but not plain** — reduce until the idea is clear, then make one detail ownable.
4. **Relevant, not literal** — evoke the attitude; don't draw the product. Fresh forms of familiar signs work.
5. **Distinct** — know the category; depart from what blends together.
6. **Memorable** — shape and colour are the first memory hooks; one defining feature.
7. **One idea** — explainable in one sentence; a light puzzle is good, a riddle is not.
8. **Small and large** — 16 px and 16 m; one colour; reversed; embroidered.
9. **Timeless over trendy** — build on a concept, not an effect.
10. **Foundation of a system** — never judge a logo in a void; it must seed patterns, icons, motion.
11. **Craft matters** — geometry, optical corrections, spacing; the invisible details separate good from great.
12. **Be strong, not stubborn** — defend the strategy, stay open on details, and value feedback.
Deeper reasoning: `references/principles.md`.

## Red flags — fix before showing anything

- Clip-art literalism (a tooth for a dentist, a house for real estate) or category clichés with no twist.
- Generic initials in an unmodified stock font; default-weight geometric sans with nothing ownable.
- More than three colours without a conceptual reason; gradients or shadows used to rescue a weak form.
- Details smaller than ~1/48 of the mark, hairlines, tight gaps that close at small sizes.
- Near-miss angles, lumpy curves from too many anchors, inconsistent stroke weights.
- Live `<text>`, embedded rasters, filters or masks in a "final" file.
- A concept that needs a paragraph to understand.
- Anything that looks like an existing logo — including the library's. The library is for learning, never tracing.

## Presenting concepts in chat (the checkpoint message)

```markdown
<concept overview image>

### A — <Name>  ·  <mark type>   ← recommended
**Idea:** <one sentence>
**Why it fits:** <2–3 bullets linked to the brief's adjectives/audience/competition>

### B — … / ### C — …  (same shape)

**My recommendation:** <one or two sentences, including one honest risk per concept if relevant>
**Next:** pick a direction (or tell me what you like in each). Want me to prepare the full logo kit for it?
<one-line list of what the kit contains>
```
Keep it short: the image does the work. Don't attach variants, boards or icon sets yet.

## Honesty and limits

- You can't guarantee trademark clearance; recommend a professional search (trademark databases, reverse image search).
- Font licences must allow logo use; say which fonts you assumed and that outlines were constructed or must be made.
- If you couldn't render and inspect a file, say so. Don't claim tests you didn't run.
- Library logos are trademarks of their owners — study only.
